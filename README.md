# What this?
Hufflepuff is the Python language implementation of the [Huff Programming Language](https://github.com/huff-language/huffc), a low-level programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The Huff language was designed by the (very excellent) Aztec Protocol team to develop Weierstrudel, an optimized EVM elliptic curve library, which lowers costs for users of the Aztec privacy protocol. For more information about Huff, check out the [Huff Compiler](https://github.com/huff-language/huffc), originally written in Typescript.

There's also an early stages implementation [in Rust](https://github.com/meoawtistic/ruff).

## Why should this be written in Python
For laughs, and because I haven't written a compiler before, and it sounded fun, which is the Hufflepuff spirit. 
In the tradition of Guido's Python, Schneier's Applied Cryptography, and Ethereum's Vyper: for every audited tool, there should be a hacky, insecure, fun mode. 

And because I was [nerdsniped on Twitter by Zac Williamson](https://twitter.com/Zac_Aztec/status/1535593071928279040). 

## How far along is it?
On the order of 60% written, before tests.

## Is it functional?
No! But it's getting there.

## What's the connection to Harry Potter?
Well, the original language was called Huff. And it was good. Then [meowawtistic](https://github.com/meoawtistic/ruff) wrote Ruff. And it was okay. The natural choice would have been to name this implementation something containing the word Puff. Thus, Harry Potter.
